## Introduction

Hello, this is the source repository for the AI applications for Art workshop held Feb 8th at Eastern bloc, Montreal. Content will be French and English.

### PREREQUISITE
  Be able to bring your own laptop computer to the workshop (no other device will be available) / Have beginner-to-intermediate level skills in programming / Be at least familiar with Python3 / If possible, have Python 3 installed on your laptop / be familiar with running commands on the terminal / things that won’t be covered in the workshop include: general programming skills, mathematical skills, Python 3 setup

### DESCRIPTION
  This machine learning (ML) meets arts bilingual workshop is aimed at building working knowledge of artificial intelligence for newcomers. A mix of theory and practice, the workshop builds a global view of AI for the arts through examples. Our objective: to have participants be at ease with the main concepts, vocabulary and algorithms of artificial intelligence (AI) by working together on practical projects.
